I have created a 3D animated website featuring a deep learning image classifier that identifies over 500 bird species. To ensure swift and accurate responses, I have engineered API endpoints that access model data stored in a PTH file, achieving an average response time of under 50 milliseconds and a classification accuracy of 95%. ![Screenshot](image.png)
